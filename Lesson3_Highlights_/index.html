            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is a type of “database”. It allows you to freeze-frame any project at any moment in time. The Version Control System saves a copy of that file and allows you to compare different copies of the same project file at many different stages of its development.  It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Why use Version Control?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control has many uses amongst the workforce. It’s main function, a source of successful collaboration. With a VCS, everybody on the team is able to work absolutely freely on any file at any time. The VCS will later allow you to merge all the changes into a common version. There's no question where the latest version of a file or the whole project is. It's in a common, central place: your version control system. Saving a version of your project after making changes is an essential habit. But without a VCS, this becomes tedious and confusing very quickly.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a type of Version Control System. The major difference between Git and any other VCS is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These systems of the information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time. Git doesn’t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature file system. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Why use Github?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Since GitHub has flexible review processes and prioritizes continuous integration, applying those benefits to documentation reviews and builds gives you the benefit of content management while bridging to sharing knowledge with subject matter experts. GitHub is a great match for when developers are writing documentation in source control. GitHub works well when a project is so large or distributed that no one person can know enough to write the documentation for the project.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is a Local Repository, Remote Repository?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The local repository refers to a copy on your own installation that is a cache of the remote downloads, and also contains the temporary build artifacts that you have not yet released. Remote repositories refer to any other type of repository, accessed by a variety of protocols such as file:// and http://. A Remote Repository resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members. A Local Repository resides on a local machine of an individual user. An example of a local repository would be Cloud9. An example of a remote repository would be Github.
